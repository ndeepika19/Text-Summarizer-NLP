# Text-Summarizer-NLP
A Python-based application that generates concise summaries of large text documents. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the NLTK library to extract the most relevant sentences.

# Features

Summarizes large text documents into a few key sentences.

Provides options to set the length of the summary.

Supports multiple text formats (e.g., .txt, .pdf).

Easy-to-use command-line interface or GUI (if applicable).

# Technology Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

NumPy (optional, for efficient calculations)

Optional Tools:

PyPDF2 (for handling PDF files)

Tkinter (if GUI is included)

# Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarizer.git
cd text-summarizer

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download NLTK data files:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Usage

Command-Line Interface (CLI):

Run the summarizer script:

python summarizer.py --input <path-to-text-file> --length <number-of-sentences>

# Example:

python summarizer.py --input example.txt --length 5

GUI (if applicable):

Run the GUI script:

python summarizer_gui.py

Upload a file and generate the summary with just a click.

# Algorithm Overview

Text Preprocessing:

Tokenize sentences.

Remove stopwords and perform stemming/lemmatization (optional).

Sentence Scoring:

Calculate scores based on word frequency or other criteria.

Summary Extraction:

Select the top-scoring sentences to form the summary.

# Future Enhancements

Add support for summarizing web content (e.g., HTML pages).

Implement advanced NLP techniques using SpaCy or Hugging Face.

Add multilingual support for summaries.
